TODO:

- Don't free instance immediately in Volatile/Best-effort mode, but use
  hc_acknowledge() after marshalling => needs key data from instance.

- Add proper ownership code to handle NOT_ALIVE_NO_WRITERS correctly as well
  as enabling Exclusive/Shared ownership.

- Add liveness mechanism.

- Add Central Discovery mechanism.

- Add support for IPv6.

- Proper notifications needed for various listeners.

- Add Dynamic Type/Data APIs.

- Rewrite Typesupport module for X-types.

- Write IDL-compiler for C.

- Add C++ support.

- Add Java support.

- Fix races/bugs:

	* random_level() uses a global var and can deadlock.
	* competing calls for remove proxy from both Discovery and Application.
	* Sometimes with large amounts of data, RTPS handshake doesn't work.
